						<h4> Stuart G</h4>
						<p>
						I was in a truck accident for the first time in my life about six weeks ago. It was the first accident I have ever had in my life and the first time I had to find an auto body shop to fix my truck. Friend of ours mentioned that they have had work done on their car at Holton Street Auto Body shop in Dracut, Ma. So not knowing one shop from another we decided to drive by Holton Street Auto Body on a weekend to see what the shop looked like. To our amazement, Holton Street Auto Body Shop was not your typical auto body shop, where pieces of cars are all around the outside. This place was immaculate, a clean, well maintained exterior.</p>
						<p>
						The next working day I called to schedule the work to be performed on my truck. Being my first time, John was very helpful in walking me through the process of getting my truck there so that work can get started. I visited the shop soon after my truck was delivered and met with both Barbara and Carl. Barbara was very pleasant to work with, as she helped me complete the necessary paper work and Carl walked me through the process by which the damaged parts on my truck will get replaced. As I mentioned the exterior of their shop was immaculate, well the same goes for the inside. Their shop was very well maintained and everything was neat and orderly. Since my truck was fairly new, the replacement parts for my truck had to be new. Getting the new parts took a little longer than expected but the quality of the work was totally worth it. The day I picked up my truck, Carl spent time with me to go over all the details that he went through during the time to repair my truck and he did such a fabulous job that you could not tell that anything ever happened.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						I am highly recommending Holton Street Auto Body in Dracut, MA. for any vehicle body work that you need done. Since this was my first experience and hopefully last experience, it was the best experience.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Thank you Barbara, Carl and John. Sincerely, Stuart G

								Dear Carl, Thank you for resurrecting my car from the dead. It is so nice to have it back even if I am still a little nervous driving. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Thank you also for making Andy's beloved new car beautiful again. It is his first fancy car and so it is nice to have it be fancy again.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thanks also for helping me get the Mustang to pass inspection. Your suggestion did the trick and we sold it soon after. 
							</p>
							<p>
								We are very grateful, Kate and Andy

							<h4>Cindy Baker</h4>
							<p>I highly recommend Holton Street uto Body in Dracut, MA. They did a custom paint job on my Camaro. They worked within my budget, delivered what they promised, and surpassed my expectations. I am VERY picky about my cars. I have referred many of my friends to them and they are all very pleased with the collision repairs and detailing of their cars. 
							It is a really nice facility that is clean and organized. They mix their own paint so your colors are spot on perfect. They also offer "Water Transfer Printing" now which is really cool way to transfer graphic designs like camouflage and carbon fiber to anything you want from Guns to Motorcycle tanks. 
							</p>
							<p>
							The owner Carl is a really decent honest guy who strikes the perfect balance between personable and professional. The rest of the staff from Barbara in the office to Rich who does the detailing all provide great services too.

							Carl, The car looks great! Would you be able to look at our other Toyota wagon when you are in the area and give us a quote? The rust isn't as bad but it is there.

							Thanks again, Claire Jacobs

							Carl, Thank you for your time, material and talent today! I also enjoyed talking with you, Barbara and Earl. I truly appreciate and admire your ability as both a business man and a technician (and it shows). You can be proud of all you have worked for. I am sure you will reap the benefits of your efforts.
